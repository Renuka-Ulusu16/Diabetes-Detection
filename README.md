# 🩺 Diabetes Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a predictive model that accurately identifies whether a person has diabetes based on diagnostic health measurements. Using machine learning algorithms and data analysis, we strive to assist early diagnosis and contribute to better health management.
